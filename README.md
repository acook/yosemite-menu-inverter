Can’t wait for apps to be updated to support the dark theme of Yosemite?

Run this script:

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mxcl/yosemite-menu-inverter/master/invert.rb | ruby

Here’s a Twitter friendly URL:

    curl -L http://bit.ly/yosinvert  | ruby

Currently supports Dropbox. Submit your own additions!

I added 1Password in the README commented out as it needs work.
