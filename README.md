Can’t wait for apps to be updated to support the dark theme of Yosemite?

![White Menu Icons](http://methylblue.com/junk/yosinvert.png)

Run this script:

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mxcl/yosemite-menu-inverter/master/invert.rb | ruby

Here’s a Twitter friendly URL:

    curl -L http://bit.ly/yosinvert  | ruby

Currently supports Dropbox. Submit your own additions!

I added 1Password in the script (commented out as it needs work).
