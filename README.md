Can’t wait for apps to be updated to support the dark theme of Yosemite?

![White Menu Icons](http://methylblue.com/junk/yosinvert.png)

Run this script:

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mxcl/yosemite-menu-inverter/master/invert.rb | ruby

Here’s a Twitter friendly URL:

    curl -L http://bit.ly/yosinvert  | ruby

Currently supports:

* Dropbox
* Window Magnet
* Radium
* Degrees
* BitTorrent Sync
* Crashlytics
* TestFlight
* Pomodoro Timer
* CrashPlan

There is commented out code for 1Password in the script. Run it manually, or submit the proper fixes (it works, just requires some human thinking that could easily be made into code).
